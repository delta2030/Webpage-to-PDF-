The whole project can be divided into two problem statements-
   a.Converting any url into PDF.
   b.Extracting URL of a webpage via a chrome extension
The solution of the two problems are discussed below
a.Converting any url into PDF
For coverting any given URL into PDF, I used PUPPETEER library, this library is used to download headless (i.e. without UI) webpages. It opens a new browser
when launched and opens the specified url which is later downloaded as pdf in the directory and format specified.

b.Extracting URL of a webpage via a chrome extension
In order to extract URL of a webpage I used Chrome API BY USING chrome.tabs.query() syntax which store all the currently opened sites in the array tabs,
in this array tabs[0] is the currently active tab and tabs[0].url provides the url of the currently active tab. For this function to work without error I 
specified the permission of 'active tab' in manifest.json .

ISSUES:
The two problems were quite solvable independently but on combining the a few issues specifically two started arising, these issues are listed below-
a.The program wasn't able to read PUPPETEER Function-
The program on running wasn't able to dentify puppeteer library ebven when it was installed in the directory.

b.Recieving end not defined
This error arose beacause the computer wasn't able to recognise that send message syntax of google API and was paired with event listener, so the error 
showed that receiver end wasn't defined. On doing research for this problem I figured out that there was a syntax added in the newer versions of chrome 
API but implementing thaat bought about no change.
